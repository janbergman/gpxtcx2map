* Upload map and GPS track through the menu.
* Two point align: Roughly adjust the track to the course by clicking on a control ring or clicking on the track and then dragging to its position on the map. Do the same for another point as far away from the first as possible.
* Fine-tune with more points if nessesary.
* If you change your mind, you can click again.

Note: the rings are a bit hard to see, so it may be a good idea to zoom in a bit when adjusting.

When you are finished, you can download by pressing "d" on the keyboard.

This program was "vibe-coded" with Gemini CLI and OpenAI Codex.
